# 🌾 Rural Welfare Voice Assistant

## ✅ Small Insight on Existing Systems

Many government digital services exist globally — like India’s UMANG, Digilocker, or even international welfare apps. But these are often:

- Complex, text-heavy
- English-centric or single-language only
- Built for urban smartphone users
- Lacking real human-like guidance

Existing systems typically **stop at information access** and leave rural users to figure out complex steps themselves.

## ❤️ The Impact We Care About

We want to ensure:

- **Last-mile delivery:** Not just “info about schemes” but *actual application, approval, and benefit*.
- **Inclusivity:** Supporting illiterate, elderly, and rural citizens through voice guidance in *local dialects*.
- **Trust and Transparency:** Data security, clear consent, and human-officer fallback.
- **Empowerment:** Equipping users to **learn** and **navigate independently**, bridging the digital literacy gap.

## 🗺️ Why This App is Needed

During our **EY Techathon 5.0 problem context**, the challenge focused on:

> *“Making government welfare schemes more accessible through digital technology.”*

**We found** that despite government portals existing:
- Rural people often don’t know they exist.
- Interfaces are not in local languages or dialects.
- They can't figure out what benefits they're eligible for.
- They worry about document security or errors.
- They don’t trust AI to make decisions without human oversight.

Our app fixes these by being **voice-first**, **multilingual**, **simple**, and **agent-based** with clear human support paths.

## 📊 Survey Insights

We conducted a **pre-implementation survey** among 26 respondents:

✅ Spread via college friends/relatives in rural South India, plus LinkedIn outreach in North India.

✅ Some students used AI to fill it in (we filtered them carefully).

**Key findings:**
- Most had little/no exposure to AI or e-governance.
- Strong demand for **local-language and voice support**.
- Concerns about **data privacy** and **app complexity**.
- High interest in **workshops** to learn.
- Desire for clear step-by-step guidance for documents and schemes.
